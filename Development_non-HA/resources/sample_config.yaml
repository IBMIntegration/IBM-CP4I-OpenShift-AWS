# A list of OpenShift nodes that used to run Cloud Pak foundation components
#
# You can use your OpenShift master and infrastructure nodes here, or install these components
# to dedicated OpenShift compute nodes. You can specify more than one node for each type to
# build a high availability cluster.
#
# The node names here should match the node names produced by the `oc get nodes` command.
#
# To run Cloud Pak foundation components on an OpenShift master or infrastructure node, you must
# ensure it is labelled as a compute node:
# oc label node <master node name/infrastructure node name> node-role.kubernetes.io/compute=true
cluster_nodes:
  master:
    - ip-10-0-1-75.us-east-2.compute.internal

    - ip-10-0-1-129.us-east-2.compute.internal
  management:
    - ip-10-0-1-129.us-east-2.compute.internal

  # These values are used by the installer to communicate with OpenShift and install components.
  # They should match the hostname and port used to connect to the OpenShift console.
  console:
    host: ocp.mydomain.com
    port: 8443

  # These values define the hostname to use for the Cloud Pak foundation console and proxy. These
  # hostnames should resolve to the IP address of the OpenShift router, which is typically the
  # infrastructure node, or the load balancer that manages traffic for multiple infrastructure
  # nodes.
  router:
    cluster_host: icp-console.apps.ocp.mydomain.com
    # &proxy is a YAML anchor that allows us to refer to this value later when configuring
    # the IBM Cloud Pak for Integration Platform Navigator

# These values control the Cloud Pak foundation proxy ports. If you ues a dedicated node for the
# Cloud Pak foundation proxy you will be able to connect to the proxy by directly connecting to the
# node. If there are other services using these ports on the selected node, the Cloud Pak foundation
# proxy service will not start successfully unless you change to use different ports here.
#
# You will always be able to connect to the Cloud Pak foundation proxy by using the value defined
# above for openshift.console.proxy_host.
